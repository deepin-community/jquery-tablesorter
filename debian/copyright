Comment: The docs directory contained multiple files without source, like
 minified jquery.  The dist folder contains pre-build files, which are removed
 to prevent the effort to prove they can be made identical with tools in
 Debian. The qunit files are removed because they miss the source and can be
 linked from the libjs-qunit package. The js/jquery.tablesorter.*.js files are
 remove because they are prebuilt, trigger lintian errors and we are generating
 a new source anyways.
 .
 docs/css/images/glyphicons-halflings.png can be taken from twitter-bootstrap
 .
 multiple docs/(css|js) things are not properly package in Debian and would
 nearly warrent their own package. As they are only there for the examples, I
 just strip them for now.
 .
 docs/fonts are in libjs-bootstrap
 .
